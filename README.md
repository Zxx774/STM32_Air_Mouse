# STM32_Air_Mouse
A simple airborne mouse project, currently only enables cursor movement.
MCU:STM32F103C8T6 sensor:MPU6050
Feature: The cursor hardly drifts. Regardless of the value of roll, the rotations in pitch and yaw directions are intuitive.
Explanation: I'm not very familiar with GitHub. I can only upload the core code. I haven't categorized the files either. Please forgive me.
